Create a brief proposal of what the team plans to include in the project. A checklist will be fine.

# Checklist

    A form to type in the total bill, number of guests, and the quality of service (rating out of 5) with button to submit
        create object from these inputs
        id = TotalBill
        id = numGuests
        id = ServQual
    A div with outputs total tip, tip percentage, average tip per person, etc.
        put into array output
    Formula to calculate the tip
        tipPercent = .05*quality of serice*{something with guests}
        if tipPercent <something && numGuests , make tipPercent 10%
        totalBill*tipPercent
    css later I guess

Originally, we decided the following:

    Andrew
        HTML
        Some JS
    Ai
        CSS
        Some JS

But you can look at the commit history to see what we each contributed.
