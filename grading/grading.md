# Grading

# Total bill, number of guests, and quality of service

index.html, used in index.js calculate various values

# Proposal

proposal.md

# HTML, CSS, JavaScript

index.html, stlye.css, index.js

# Primative data types

e.g. in index.js:
form inputs are `Number`,
(inputs.getNumGuests > 5) and (inputs.getNumGuests > 1) are `boolean`

# Objects

e.g. in index.js:
the `inputs` objects is used throughout,
anonymous `Data()` instances are pushed onto `arrHist`

# Arrays

e.g. in index.js:
`arrHist` is used to store the history of submissions

# `this` keyword

e.g. in index.js:
`Data()` set and get method declarations

# be creative and include OOP

Don't worry; Mari Kondo is crying

number of guests: takes number input, line 32 html file
quality of service: takes input, line 45
data types:
    null in line 75
    forced numbers for input in html file (i.e., line 35)

objects: made using the Data() class line 4 of JS file
Arrays:
this. keyword: repeatedly used, first instance line 6 of JS
OOP: the JS file (use classes, set, get, etc.) -->
